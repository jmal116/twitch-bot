*Extraordinarily painful double bash chains that cause complete and total agony when attempted* because of how hard to #effectively execute they are#, a good example of this would be to take a $Baneling$ from @Horu fields@ all the way to the *blue wall* at #Valley entry#, I also think I owe you an apology for adding something quite this long to the list of $experience$ names you use, so I am truly sorry about that @(not really)@
